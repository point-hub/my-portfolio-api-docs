# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Pointhub API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Pointhub API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Pointhub API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/health-check">
```typescript {{ title: 'axios' }}
const response = axios.get('/health-check')
```
</CodeGroup>
<CodeGroup title="Response">
```json {{ title: '200' }}
// empty response
```
</CodeGroup>

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Pointhub API:
